1. Edit the following text. [5] 
I reassure you of one thing. At any point in a period of spiritual endeavor you can experience space and stillness. Every time you realize a truth; every time you sense the hand of god in your life or the incidentally support of a fellow traveler, you become mentally still. Every time you are blessed with an insight, see someones in a different light. 

2. Read the given text and interpret its meaning: [5] 
Broken friendship may be repaired but the break will always show. Friendship is a precious thing—too precious a treasure to be carelessly broken or thrown away. The world handles the word ‘friend’ lightly; its real, true, deeper meaning is forgotten. Your friend is one who appreciates you—your faults as well as your virtues. He understands and sympathizes with your defeats and victories, your aims and ideals, your joys and temptations, your hopes and disappointments, as no one else does or can. It is your friend to whom you turn for counsel, for comfort, for praise; he may not be as learned as some or as wise as others. Blessed is the man or woman into whose life has come the beauty and power of such a friendship. Prize it well. Do all in your power to keep such a friendship unbroken. Avoid the break, for when it comes it cannot be mended and the jarring note mars the harmony. 

3. Study the following passage carefully. Then prepare its notes and summary. [5+5] 
Dowsing the millennia-old practice of finding hidden things. The most well-known activity of dowsing involves the use of a device such as a forked stick to locate underground water. To this end, the dowser walks slowly back and forth over an area of ground holding the dowsing tool out in front with both hands. It is said that the dowser, by concentrating carefully is somehow able to feel the energy of the flowing underground streams vibrating through the rod at certain frequencies, and thus is able to tell precisely where to dig or drill to find water. Sometimes the dowsing tool will twist and jerk or suddenly point downward. Some dowsers hold two L-shaped rods, one in each hand. In this case, when he or she walks over an area of underlying water, the rods cross over indicating the place where digging should commence. In recent years dowsing has gained in popularity not only as a method for finding underground water but also for trying to uncover other objects including buried treasure, oil, or even dead bodies. A recent application has been the search for what some consider harmful energy fields in an attempt to avoid them. Even large businesses and official organizations pay dowsers for their detection skills. Although no one is completely sure how dowsing works, the testimonials of satisfied customers bear witness to the success of this ancient art.

Hamlet had just enough life left in him to hear to hear Goratio’s promise: then whispering the words the rest in silence he sank down dead such was the end of the brave and noble prince of Denmark.

3. Study the following text carefully. Prepare its note and convert it into a summary. [5+5] 
All people who speak the same language have agreed to use certain words for certain jobs and this enables them to communicate with each other. There is nothing particularly remarkable about the words themselves: they might just as well have chosen different ones. What matters is that this agreement about the use of words should be fully understood, and understood in detail, by everyone who wishes to profit by them. Let us take example of bell ringing. By itself, the ringing of a bell means nothing. But in certain recognized contexts, it may mean different things as different as ‘time for school!’, ‘somebody at the door!’, ‘that’s the end of the lesson’ or ‘come here, please, waitress!’. We might well wonder how it is that the same noise can mean so many different things; but of course the answer is easy. The noise occurs in recognized contexts; in times and places when we know that it can only mean one thing. Thus all most anything can be used to communicate several different things. Let us apply this to verbal signs, or words. First we can communicate just as well by using ‘father’, ‘pater’, ‘Daddy’, or anything else: provided we are understood, it makes no difference. We can invent a completely new word too. Secondly, the same collection of letters can be used to communicate quite different things. The word ‘port’ can mean a special sort of wine, the opposite of starboard, a harbor, the various other things. The significance of any sign, therefore, depends on the context in which it is used.

1. Edit the following text: [5] 
What she goes on to describe is if you think about it a perverse variation of Theseus paradise. What if you started replacing the solid planks of his ship with rotten ones is it still the same ship after one plank is replaced how about half of them is there a point when Gerda is no longer gerda? 

2. Read the given text and interpret its meaning: [5] 
We are all short-sighted and very often see but one side of a matter; our views are not extended to all that has a connection with it. From this defect, I think no man is free. We see but in part, and we know but in part, and therefore, it is no wonder we conclude not right from our partial views. This might instruct the proudest esteemer of his own parts how useful it is to talk and consult with others, even such as come short of him in capacity, quickness and penetration; for since no one sees all, and we generally have different prospects of the same thing, according to our different, as I may say, positions to it, it is not incongruous to think, nor beneath any man to try, whether another man not have notions of things which have escaped him, and which his reason would make use of if they came into his mind. 

3. Read the following passage carefully, make notes and write a summary of it: [5+5] 
There are hundreds of superstitions which survive in various parts of the country and the story of them is rather amusing. We are told, for example, that is unlucky to point to the new moon or to look at it through glass, but if we bow nine times to it we shall have a lucky month. Now, suppose you tell a scientist that you believe a certain superstition-let us say, that the bowling of a dog is a sign of death. The scientist will immediately require evidence before he can accept your belief. He will want figures to prove it. It will be useless to quote two or three cases; he will want hundreds. He will want also to know (a) if it ever happens that the bowling of dogs is not followed by a death, (b) if ever a person’s death is predicted by the bowling of dogs. The answer to the former question is in the affirmative, and to the latter in the negative. Your superstition will not bear investigation. It may impress an ignorant person; but it cannot face the light of facts. Your case would not carry conviction in a court of law. Apart from this process of testing by results, any intelligent man will want to know the “reason why”. What connection can there be between a bowling dog and an approaching death? Can it be cause and effect? Can it be that the dog has a gift of foreseeing such events? Or is the dog the instrument employed by some uncanny power that moves invisibly in our midst? 

4. Answer any two of the following questions: [5x2=10] 
a) What do the audience need to possess to enable themselves to understand the meaning intended by the speaker or writer? Explain with examples. (Straight and Crooked Thinking) 
b) Why was Monna Marinna blasphemed as “the mother of a traitor” by the city dwellers? (The Mother of a Traitor) 
c) How can the inventions of science be both curse and boon for human beings? (Use and Misuse of Science) 

5. Choose the best answer: [0.5x10=5] 
a) All I need now……………..your love. (is, are) 
b) The police………………..arrested and imprisoned him. (has, have) 
c) Had you been more cautious, you…………..with the accident. (will never meet, would never meet, would never have met, can never meet) 
d) My boss rewarded me for what I ………………..(do, did, have done, had done)

Men have never succeeded in keeping free from war in the past. Nor are they likely to do so in the future, as long as they are organized in separate nation states, each of which is in control of its own army, navy and air force and each of which is, therefore, to control the government believes, however, wrongly that he can obtain an advantage for himself and his country. Only some form of world government, which controls all the world’s armed forces and against which no single nation or group of nations could wage war since they would not have the wherewithal to do so, can finally save the world from war. Secondly, science, by accelerating man’s speed of movement, has made the world a single whole. Hence any war which breaks out anywhere will destroy the whole of civilization and not merely the part affected by the war, as has been the case in the past. That is why the new powers conferred upon man by science increasingly demand a world government if they are not to result in man’s destruction.

For half of the day we are slave to necessities which we cannot shirk, whether we are monarchs with a thousand servants or humble laborers with no servants but their wives. And the wives must undertake the additional heavy slavery of child-bearing if the world is still to be peopled. These natural jobs cannot be shirked. But they involve other jobs which can. As we must eat we must first provide food; as we must sleep we must have beds and bedding in houses with fireplaces and coals; now, food and houses and clothes can be produced by human labour. If you are too lazy to get about from place to place on your own legs, you can make a slave of a horse.

3. After reading the text given below carefully, make notes and write summary of it: [5+5] 
We can alter the characteristics of steel in various ways. In the first place, steel which contains very little carbon will be milder than steel which contains a higher percentage of carbon, up to the limit of about 1.5%. Secondly, we can heat the steel above a certain critical temperature, changes begin to take place in the molecular structure of the metal. In the process known as annealing, we heat the steel above the critical temperature and permit it to cool very slowly. This causes the metal to become softer than before, and much easier to machine. Annealing has a second advantage. It helps to relieve any internal stresses which exist in the metal. These stresses are liable to occur through hammering or working the metal, or through rapid cooling. Metal which we cause to cool rapidly contracts more rapidly on the outside than on the inside. This produces unequal contractions, which may give rise to distortion or cracking. Metal which cools slowly is less liable to have these internal stresses than metal which cools quickly. On the other hand, we can make steel harder by rapid cooling. We heat it up beyond the critical temperature, and then quench it in water or some other liquid. The rapid temperature drop fixes the structural change in the steel which occurred at the critical temperature, and makes it very hard. But a bar of this hardened steel is more liable to fracture than normal steel. We therefore heat it again to a temperature below the critical temperature, and cool it slowly. This treatment is called tempering. It helps to relieve the internal stresses, and makes the steel less brittle than before. The properties of tempered steel enable us to use it in the manufacture of tools which need a fairly hard steel. High carbon steel is harder than tempered steel, but it is in much more difficult to work. These heat treatments take place during the various shaping operations. We can obtain bars and sheets of steel by rolling the metal through huge rolls in a rolling-mill. The roll pressures must be much greater for cold rolling than for hot rolling, but cold rolling enables the operators to produce rolls of great accuracy and uniformity, and with a better surface finish. Other shaping operations include drawing into wire, casting in molds, and forging.
